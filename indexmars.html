            <p align="left">Mars in the past had a magnetic field that secured its atmosphere. Approximately 4.2 billion years ago, Mars’s magnetic field suddenly vanished. Without its atmosphere it will continue to be a cold, dry place without life. The Red Planet lacks a global magnetic field like Earth’s making it more vulnerable to direct impact of solar storms. 
            <br>
            The recently captured solar storms led to a thinning of Mars’s already thin atmosphere causing climate change and radiation. Mars’s description on solar storms requires similar parameters to those used on Earth. NASA’s MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) orbiter is of a great significance collecting and providing continuous data about glowing auroras over the planet, which are in many ways different than those captured on Earth. 
            <br>
            Other ways of gathering information about the Red Planet (Voyager, Parker Solar Probe and the upcoming ESCAPADE) are proved to have been successful and were utilized by the general scientific community. The primary parameter used to describe Solar storms on Mars is the Solar wind speed density. 
            <br>
            The average quantity of the Curiosity rover equals 700 micrograys (a SI measurement unit of absorbed radiation dose of ionizing radiation such as X-rays), however this year’s most extreme solar storm drastically increased that number to 8100 micrograys, which caused the rover to go offline for a certain amount of time. These shockingly high levels of radiation put the future possibility of life on Mars in question, thus rendering the conditions for life more difficult than they already are.
