            <p align="left">Four-and-a-half billion years ago, Earth’s surface was a hot mess, temperatures were very high and the air was toxic. Our planet was uninhabitable. But Moon’s shield may have helped Earth’s retain its atmosphere and eventually go to develop life. Because of gravity, the existence of the Moon stabilized the Earth’s spin axis. 
            <br>
            According to one computer model scientists created, the polar regions of the Earth and the Moon would have been magnetic connected through their shared magnetosphere. As the Moon’s core cooled down, it began to lose its magnetic field. Everything that we have known about magnetic fields tells us that a body of the Moon’s size should not be able to generate field that’s as strong as Earth’s. The Moon has a very weak magnetic field compared to Earth. 
            <br>
            It has localized magnetic regions in the lunar crust. Because of the weak magnetic field the Moon is more exposed to solar storms and radiation. The same parameters that are used on the Earth like (solar wind, proton-electron flux, magnetic field data, etc.) are applied to predict conditions on the Moon.
